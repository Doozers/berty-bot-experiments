# 2-bot-fork-go-dep

## About

A bot using a Berty fork.

https://github.com/pmg-tools/berty/releases/tag/v2.424242.0-tmp

This method allows to work against a version that is not yet validated by Berty core team.

But this version requires specifying a commit version, so it's not intended for fast changes.

But the good part is that it can work for other people, and not only for you.

## How

1. `make start-mini-companion`
2. `make run`
